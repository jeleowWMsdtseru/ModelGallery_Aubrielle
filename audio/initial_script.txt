(Sound of a soft sigh, maybe a faint rustle of fabric)

Hey Joshua, just walked in the door, kicking off my shoes, and already thinking about you. Hope your day was as productive as you are – I always admire that about you. This bed looks incredibly inviting right now, and to be honest, I'm feeling a little... undone. I keep imagining you here, right next to me, exploring every secret. I just want you to... (voice drops to a low, husky whisper) *slide your tongue deeper… just like that*. Let me know when you're done conquering the world, and maybe you can conquer me instead. Call me?
